## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS


### What I learned

Through this project, I have learned so much about how to structure and style the layout of this project. For example, naming CSS classes to improve the readability of what each section does has been really amazing. I have also ensured that the paddings, alignments, font size, font colours etc remain consistent to look like a consistent design. This has also helped me to improve on my coding skills.
